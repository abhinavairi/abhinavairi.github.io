Personal Portfolio (React + TypeScript)

This is a minimal React + TypeScript portfolio scaffold.

Setup
1. Copy your resume PDF to the public folder as "resume.pdf":
   cp ../Resume_Abhinav_Airi.pdf public/resume.pdf

2. Install dependencies and run the dev server:
   npm install
   npm run dev

Build
   npm run build
   npm run preview

Notes
- The embedded resume expects the file at /resume.pdf (public/resume.pdf).
- Edit content in `src/components` to update About, Projects and Contact.
